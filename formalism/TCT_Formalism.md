THE SCARLET–VANACKER FORMALISM







With Torsional Correspondence Theory (TCT)





Date: January 2026

Formalism: VanAcker

Status: Formal Theoretical Framework

Domain: Cosmology, spacetime structure, matter correspondence








ABSTRACT





We present the Scarlet–VanAcker formalism, a geometric framework in which spacetime possesses intrinsic torsional elasticity and a small, fixed global chiral bias. Cosmological evolution proceeds through a non-singular torsional bedrock rather than a curvature singularity, preserving phase information and global coherence without inflationary erasure.



To address the emergence and structure of matter, we introduce Torsional Correspondence Theory (TCT), which interprets matter as a discrete spectrum of long-lived torsional eigenmodes of the spacetime fabric. Stability is governed by recursive stress minimization under global torsion, with the golden ratio φ emerging naturally as the optimal nesting ratio. Radioactive decay corresponds to topological shedding when no further φ-compatible configurations exist.



This framework does not replace quantum mechanics or nuclear physics; it provides a geometric explanation for the existence of discreteness, stability peaks, and material limits.








I. PHILOSOPHICAL POSTURE AND MOTIVATION





Modern cosmology explains large-scale uniformity primarily through mechanisms that erase historical structure. Scarlet adopts the opposite principle:



Structure should be explained by constraint, not erased to achieve smoothness.


Scarlet assumes that spacetime:



is elastic rather than rigid,
can store and redistribute torsional stress,
and evolves under global boundary conditions that persist across cosmic history.




Matter, in this view, is not fundamental. It is the long-lived geometric response of spacetime under persistent torsional constraint.








II. FOUNDATIONAL ASSUMPTIONS (SCARLET CORE)







II.1 Elastic–Torsional Spacetime





Spacetime is modeled as a continuous manifold supporting both curvature and intrinsic torsion. Torsion is treated as a physical, energy-carrying degree of freedom, not merely an auxiliary variable.




$\theta_{\text{global}} \approx 0.21^\circ$



II.2 Global Chiral Bias





A small, fixed global torsional asymmetry exists:



\theta_{\text{global}} \approx 0.21^\circ



This bias functions as a boundary condition, observable through cosmic birefringence, and applies universally.








II.3 Torsional Bedrock (Non-Singular Origin)





At approximately



t \sim 10^{-41}\,\text{s}



torsional stress saturates without divergence. A bounce or phase transition replaces the classical Big Bang singularity. Curvature remains finite, and phase information is preserved.








III. COSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION





Pre-bedrock phase: high torsional density, strong coupling
Torsional release: stress redistribution replaces inflation
Post-bedrock expansion: coherence seeded without erasure
Late-time universe: residual torsion governs large-scale order




Scarlet predicts inherited coherence rather than regenerated randomness.








IV. THE NEED FOR MATTER CORRESPONDENCE





Scarlet explains:



non-singular origin,
large-scale coherence,
global order.




It does not explain:



why matter is discrete,
why stability peaks exist,
why elements terminate.




This motivates Torsional Correspondence Theory (TCT).

Definition





Matter corresponds to discrete, topologically protected torsional eigenmodes of spacetime under the Scarlet background.



This is a correspondence claim, not a reduction.








VI. THE FOUR POSTULATES OF TCT







Postulate 1 — Torsional Eigenmodes





Matter corresponds to discrete, long-lived torsional knot classes stabilized by topology and energy minimization.








Postulate 2 — Recursive Shielding





Higher-energy configurations minimize stress through nested torsional loops governed by:



T_{n+1} = f(T_n)



This produces shell structure and periodicity.








Postulate 3 — Golden-Ratio Stability





Energy-minimizing recursive nesting converges toward:



\frac{T_{n+1}}{T_n} \rightarrow \varphi \approx 1.618



φ emerges as the optimal ratio minimizing overlap stress.








Postulate 4 — Yield and Decay





When no φ-compatible nesting exists, stability fails and the system undergoes topological shedding, corresponding to radioactive decay.








VII. THE TORSIONAL PERIODIC TABLE (CORRESPONDENCE)
| Family | Elements | Mechanical State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primordials** | H, He | Bare torsion |
| **Chiral-Bio** | C, N, O | Optimal phi-flex |
| **Resonants** | Fe, Ni | Harmonic phi-lock |
| **Structural** | Ag, Au | High-Z multi-loop shielding |
| **Yield-Edge** | Pb, Bi | Terminal elasticity |
| **Transients** | U, Pu | Mechanical failure (shedding) |


Mechanical failure (shedding)

This table classifies geometric stability, not chemistry.








VIII. THE SPECIAL ROLE OF IRON





Iron corresponds to a global resonance between:



recursive nesting,
φ-stability,
and background torsional frequency.




This explains its maximal binding and cosmological prominence.








IX. RELATION TO EXISTING PHYSICS





Scarlet–TCT:



does not modify the Standard Model,
does not compute spectra or decay constants,
does not unify forces.




It addresses why structure exists, not how interactions are calculated.








APPENDIX A







Toy Energy Functional and φ-Convergence





To establish mechanical plausibility, we define a minimal energy functional:



E = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left[ \alpha T_n^2 + \beta (T_{n+1} - \lambda T_n)^2 \right]



Energy minimization with respect to \lambda yields convergence toward:



\lambda \rightarrow \varphi



This demonstrates that φ emerges naturally as the optimal recursive nesting ratio in elastic torsional systems. Beyond a critical nesting depth, no minimum exists, defining a natural stability cutoff.








APPENDIX B







What the Theory Explains — and What It Does Not







Explains:





discreteness of matter
periodic families
stability peaks
material limits
universality of decay






Does Not Explain:





atomic spectra
decay lifetimes
particle interactions
chemistry mechanisms
force unification




Scarlet–TCT is ontological, not computational.








APPENDIX C







Hostile Referee Critique (with Responses)





Objection: “This is metaphorical.”

Response: The framework is explicitly a correspondence theory with defined postulates and an existence-proof energy functional.



Objection: “φ is numerology.”

Response: φ emerges from energy minimization in recursive elastic systems and is not assumed.



Objection: “No falsifiable predictions.”

Response: The theory fails if no global torsional bias exists, if stability has no termination, or if iron’s stability is non-resonant.



Objection: “Overreach.”

Response: Scope is explicitly limited and stated.








X. CONCLUSION





Scarlet describes a universe governed by elastic torsional geometry under global constraint.

TCT explains matter as the spectrum of stable geometric responses to that constraint.



Together, they provide a closed, coherent explanation for:



why the universe has structure,
why matter is discrete,
and why decay is inevitable.




This is not a final theory.

It is a formal, defensible framework.
